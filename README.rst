`smallshapes` implements simple mathematical shapes and geometrical operations
in 2D, 3D and low dimensions. This library was created as in order to provide
collision primitives to a game engine but may be useful in other contexts.

    * Implements AABB's, Circle and Convex Polygons.
    * More stuff in the future ;-)
